# torraubpoc

torraub is a tool to stop ransomware attacks when an infection has already happened end encryption is starting.

Why 'torraub'?
Torraub is an austrian term for performing an emergency brake in football/soccer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_foul).
I'm neither from Austria nor interested in football - as long as it is not american football / NFL. 
My torraub is a deliberate act of foul play on the process level intended to bring about an advantage in the fight against ransomware.
